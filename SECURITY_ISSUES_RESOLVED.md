## 🔐 1. Authentication & Authorization

### ❌ **Issues Identified:**
- Missing user verification and API key validation
- No request signing or session handling in place  
- Endpoints openly accessible

### ✅ **Status: FULLY RESOLVED**
- Implemented PostgreSQL database integration with full API key validation
- Added JWT session management with secure authentication flows
- All endpoints now require proper authentication and authorization
- Database-backed validation system ensures real-time security verification

---

## 🚦 2. Rate Limiting

### ❌ **Issues Identified:**
- No rate limiting implemented
- Opens system to abuse, credit theft, and potential DDoS attacks

### ✅ **Status: FULLY RESOLVED**
- Implemented database-backed rate limiting system
- 100 requests per minute limit per API key
- Real-time tracking and enforcement
- Comprehensive usage logging for monitoring

---

## 📊 3. Error Handling & Monitoring

### ❌ **Issues Identified:**
- Errors failing silently in some places
- Occasionally returning unencrypted data
- Need structured error logging

### ✅ **Status: FULLY RESOLVED**
- Comprehensive error handling across all endpoints
- Structured logging without exposing sensitive data
- Consistent error response patterns
- Frontend and backend error management systems

---

## 🧹 4. Resource Management

### ❌ **Issues Identified:**
- Potential memory leaks from event listeners not being cleaned up properly
- Pending requests need better cleanup

### ✅ **Status: FULLY RESOLVED**
- Database connection pooling with proper resource management
- React component cleanup patterns implemented
- Memory leak prevention measures in place
- Proper lifecycle management throughout the application

---

## 🔒 5. Encryption

### ❌ **Issues Identified:**
- Default encryption key is hardcoded (significant security risk)
- Should move to environment-based key management

### ✅ **Status: FULLY RESOLVED**
- Environment-based configuration with no hardcoded secrets
- Bcrypt password hashing with salt rounds
- Cryptographically secure API key generation
- Proper secret management across all components
